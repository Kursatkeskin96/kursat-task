# Hotel Listing Page

This repository contains a web application for a hotel listing page, developed as part of a technical assessment for a company. The application allows users to view a list of hotels and sort them based on different criteria. The design was provided by the company, and the implementation includes several interactive features.

## Features

- **Sorting Options:** Users can sort the hotel results by price (default), star rating, and alphabetically by hotel name. Sorting by star rating and hotel name includes visual highlights when active.
- **Expanded Descriptions:** Each hotel listing has a toggle button to expand and collapse the hotel description. This button includes smooth animations for a better user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, making it accessible on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **Automated Tests:** The functionality is backed by a suite of tests written with Jest to ensure the application runs as expected.
